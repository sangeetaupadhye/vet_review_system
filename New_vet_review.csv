I would not recommend this hospital to anyone.",0
"Worst hospital i have ever seen
 
 No proper treatment will be given
 No proper care will be taken
 Nurses are rude with pateint
 They treat patients as like a they are any kind of animal",0
One number office counter Staff & Public relations office staff behaviour is angry staff treat the patients very very bad like a any government office bad experience,0
"Speaks very disrespectfully. No manners at all. If you want your pet to be mishandled, please visit this clinic. You and your pet will be mistreated.",0
The doctor has no knowledge of how to treat cats... They are only interested in making money.. My child was given useless injections for deworming..,0
Worst thing happened to my retriever was this clinic. Have no means of treating anything. His men are recruited Chai wala. One got recruited right in front of me.,0
"Very bad man
 Dr tho ye kisi surat e nhi he.
 Isko manners nhi ki baat kese kerte he.
 Case bigaad ker ye bol deta he ki aap khi or try ker lo.",0
"Such an illiterate doctor, I visited him for my two cats from which that first one died because of his illiteracy and the another one also died because he was unable 
to identify her disease... I won`t recommend this clinic to anyone if anyone wants his/her pet to be safe.",0
"Not good experience. my 6 month puupy got panicked hearing other dog`s cries and pooped while bathing. Insead of comforting the dog the staff gave us tough 
looks and asked us to wait outside the clinic for our turn to cosult the vet. how can they expect a civilized behaviour from an animal that to 6 months old.",0
"Please do not visit here if you love your dog, money minded",0
"Very costly, in case of animals also they are doing business like anything, heartless people.",0
"All the reviews are clearly fake,please don`t fall for them as we did. Saini Pet Lovers is a terrible choice for pet owners. The shop as well as the kennel is so unhygienic, 
making it an unsafe environment for both pets and customers.",0
"Clinic owner does not understand basic digestive anatomy. Killed our 2.5 years old golden retriever dog by trying to stop his vomiting and did not understand symptoms 
of intestinal blockage.Kept experimenting for 4 days made dog`s condition really bad.",0
"No hygiene conditions maintained so your dogs can get contagious diseases easily from here like parvo ,distemper .My dog got it from here and died.",0
,0
Couldn't insert even the catheter which I went for caused unnecessary pain to my baby. Still took money. Not worth the argument so paid . Never visiting again.,0
"My dog passed away recently because of wrong diagnosis of the doctor. His treatment made her condition worse. She went to the clinic on her feet and after 2 days 
of treatment (with 7 injections)she was not even able to stand ever since she visited. She was suffering from kidney condition and he treated her for lungs infection. 
I had a lot of faith in his treatment but we all were wrong.",0
"He`s the worst doctor and the clinic to take your fur babies to. If you want to give your babies a sudden and brutal death, then do visit him. 
I took my baby for fever there on 29th Mar2023 and he gave her 3 injections with 9 medicines. My baby stopped eating, urinating and defecating from that moment itself. 
The next day he again gave her same injections and her condition started worsening",0
If u love your pet dont go there,0
"What a kind staff! I was searching for a new vet after my regular vet retired and had a bad experience 
with the new vets that took over his practice,
 so I was feeling a bit cautious and a little burned over that but what a difference! 
Happy receptionists and knowledgeable and patient vet techs,
 a vet who was honest and not looking to make money off of me or devise problems. 
My dog struggled with major anxiety and they were so kind and 
helpful despite that and she came out happy and fine at the end of the visit. I was so pleased",0
I feel very comfortable and know my pets needs and health are priority here.,0
Excellent service... very caring veterinarian... and staff,0
First time at this experience center was not a good experience.,0
"As expected, professionalism has gone out the window. Made a grooming booking with Jay ftom the store.. He said he's the manager apparently.
 Of course the day earlier to appointment, I call to recheck if booking is there and I was told... No booking made.",0
"I had a very disappointing and painful experience at this hospital. I went there with my sick kitten, hoping for proper diagnosis and treatment. 
Instead, I was subjected to multiple expensive scans, X-rays, blood tests, and high-cost medicines â€“ none of which provided clarity or real improvement.
 Despite fluid accumulation being visible, they continued giving her food and drips until she passed away, likely due to suffocation",0
"I lost my cat under this hospitalâ€™s care. Bloodwork had already shown liver failure, but they still pushed for a CT scan under anesthesia, assuring us it was safe. 
My cat never woke up. The scan did not change the outcome, but it robbed us of the little time we could have had left to say goodbye. I feel the procedure was 
unnecessary and done more for money than for the catâ€™s wellbeing. Extremely disappointed and heartbroken",0
"Extremely disappointed and heartbroken with the carelessness at this hospital. Despite repeatedly informing the doctors that my dog had been vomiting continuously for weeks,
 no proper diagnostic tests were conductedâ€”even though all the necessary equipment was available. Instead, medication was given without identifying the actual cause.",0
"Be careful. Too much medicines without trying to identify the cause of illness in my pet. For me it was first experience of a pet clinic in Bangalore since we moved here recently.
 They are more interested in making money than proper treatment",0
"Be really careful when you go here I took my cocker spaniel here for gastric problem they gave her too many medicines after which the dog was completely down, 
so I took a second opinion from an other doctors and I was advice that this was done only for money",0
"Worst experience. We asked to cut her hair an inch they shaved her completely. Also, they made bruises on her face while trimming, she bled and it's now a scare on her nose.
 I wanted to go there seeing all the positive responses ignoring the negative.please don't do the same mistake as me.",0
"One of the worst clinic. Many reviews were by the persons working inside the clinic. If one genuine review is posted followed by number of good reviews they were making.
 One of my friend's cat died due to their negligence. The response from them also very poor. Very pathetic! As a data analyst I have gone through all the reviews. 
Everything did not look genuine.",0
"These people are simply looting money. I've been taking my dog for vaccination sinxe 2 years and the deworming injection costs 100rs, 
but now suddenly these people are charging 500rs in which 100rs is for injection and 400rs is for consultation. When I questioned about the consultation charges, 
the doctor told if you step into the hospital you need to pay 400rs even if you don't take any consultation. Very pathetic and cheap experience with the hospital staff.",0
The staff was horrendous and the doctor seemed scared to handle our cat herself.,0
"The support staff held her down with harsh force leeding to a wound and bleeding, which has become an infection.",0
"I brought my cat here after he had been injured and missing for 4 days. Despite being badly hurt, he was urinating on his own and had signs of life â€” hope.",0
The place smells like a zoo. Not clean. The grooming section looks unclean. Even the fans here have dog hair.,0
"I had a wonderful experience at Advitha Pet Hospital! The care and treatment they provided for my pet were truly the best. 
The doctors and staff showed so much love and affection towards my pet, making us feel completely at ease. 
Their warm, friendly, and lovable conversations made every visit comfortable and stress-free. I am genuinely grateful for their dedication and the way they treated my pet 
like their own. Highly recommended.Thank you team",0
We had a very bad experience here.,0
"First it says it 24x7 but during emergency at night. They said that the doctor is available at 9 am, come after that. We had to rush to other hospital.",0
Later doctor called and said that they had doctor on duty but dont know who said that.,0
"We witnessed highly unhygienic practices , the nurse was about to use a syringe that already had blood from another animal. Only when we pointed it out to the doctor
 did they change it.",0
It became an unlucky paws for my kitten. I had a 6 month old kitten and I took him for grooming to their centre. I went on 3rd of June the centre is small not very well ventilated.,0
"I took my pet to Vetic Domlur for a simple bath, trusting that he would come back clean and comfortable. Instead, he ended up with ticks and severe itching.
 He was so restless that he couldnâ€™t even sleep at night.. it was heartbreaking to watch him suffer after I had just paid such a high amount for grooming.",0
"I hate this clinic. I recommend you all not to visit this clinic at all. They only know to kill animals and earn money by giving them various medicines. 
I lost my 50 days puppy on 12 July. I visited the clinic yesterday at 7.30 pm and she was suffering from diaherrea since last 5 days and she wasn't vomiting at all. 
We gave her some medicines orally which was fine and made her improved",0
"This review is from my experience about a few years ago, and the trigger being for posting now is that a dog from my society had died at their hospital a few days ago
 and when the family was sharing their experience with me. I, with no intention, point this out as the clinics' fault. Nor do I intend to defame the clinic in any way.",0
"We took our dog to Crown Vet Clinic as she was unwell. The vet took us to get all the reports done. While the care was good, the total bill came to around â‚¹20,000, which 
felt quite expensive.I wish the charges could be more affordable for pet owners",0
"What I am going through, I wish nobody has to go through! I lost my kitten in this clinic, they said it was doing absolutely fine and I can get it back home.
 I decided to meet my kitten in hospital and anyways next day I'll get it discharged, but!!! When went there... It had passed away! I mean how can somebody assure 
that it absolutely fine and this happens at the end! Terrible!",0
"Absolutely horrendous experience at Vetz for Petz! Took my cat here after he was attacked by stray dogs, and the level of care was shockingly poor.
 On the first visit, they claimed there was only one wound and didn't even bother prescribing antibioticsâ€”just some ointment and rabies shots. 
They repeated the same negligent treatment on the second visit.",0
"All they think is about money, my home is near that vet haspital, and the assistant doctor doesn't know anything, no knowledge about pets!
 All she said was ""I'm not sure that ur pet has this, but we will observe and see"" I lost my dog which was old, bt im sure it was bcz of their doses the previous day!",0
Worst person who has his own time says I'm not available such people cannot be called as Vet. DR Niranjan gave shame on u any ur professional abilities U r only a money making machine selfish creature one day u will face this then u will understand,0
Worst veterinary clinic ever experienced and the doctor is highly qualified but useless don't know how to treat pets.,0
Guys I want to let you genuine review before you read only just positive buyed fake comments below.,0
"I took my pet rabbit for a general health check, and I was very impressed by how carefully the staff handled such a delicate animal. They explained everything clearly and gave helpful advice on diet and habitat care. The entire place was spotless and peacefulâ€”perfect for small animals.",0
"Is an understatement for this place. Please do not take ur loved ones to this place if they quite unwell or serious. 
They will suggest extreme measures including surgery for non existent issues. Most unprofessional set of staff
 who lack moral ethics and empathy. This staff in particular is a receptionist turned Vet who did random procedures 
without a clue. He was not even willing to do an emergency care and discouraged us from taking our pet there.",0
"Due to the negligence not timely responded regards the treatment leads my dog to death. 
I never recommend to this hospital the chief doctor Venkat not even answered to the calls when an emergency dog admits in 
his hospital he should be take more care, his actions doesnâ€™t seemed to be like that.
 If any emergency to your pets donâ€™t prefer this hospital. I lost my loveable rocky due to their negligence in treatment. 
The pain of loosing a dog as a parent they donâ€™t understand",0
"I don't mean to say that the service is bad, just the employees & the management altogether are really good at just commercialing out of animals care at this point. And I've only come to write the review cause of the recurring issue with the reports that were never delivered, always had taken the samples & charged for the tests once was 600/- that's totally fine, 2nd was 3k for a ear swab test also fine, again 900 for a skin scraping. And the reports have been never shared what's so ever format, not a single call or contact from the employees or the management stating that the reports are ready, how & which format would you like us to share it with you, never not even once in 3yrs. This is such a bad experience for consulting & waiting and eventually letting it go both times. Now again having had the same experience is making me write a review here.",0
Do not get your pets blood tests here. The machines are corrupted. We got our cat tested twice here. Cat had to go through a medication because of false reports.,0
Please do not take your precious pets to this hospital. Not even a nurse is available during lunch time. Even the staff is non cooperative. No temperature checking or cleaning just because doctors are on lunch. And after all the waiting they rejected the neonatal kitten came in for treatment,0
"Their boarding is the worst experience ever had. I gave my Shih-tzu for boarding for two days. 
I had no choice, but to give them at the last moment because no boardings were available. 
The receptionist is the worst doesnâ€™t know how to talk as if their company has only proper rules and 
regulations and donâ€™t understanding and they say that they take the dogs for walk two times a day, 
but I guess they didnâ€™t even take him once because after two days, when I took him out for a walk, 
he peed like he hasnâ€™t gone since seven days and the person who takes care of the dogs, 
also doesnâ€™t know how to take care, and they donâ€™t give the dogs in hygiene, my white Shih-tzu came out dirtiest in my life. Iâ€™ve ever seen him. 
I wouldnâ€™t recommend anyone giving their dogs to boarding here.",0
"I had a terrible experience at this hospital. I rushed my dog in because he was bleeding from the nose, 
but for two hours, there was no response at all. After all that waiting, they suddenly said it was critical.",0
Worst experience ever clinic Iâ€™ve ever been to very unprofessional and commercial.,0
"Visited the hospital two days back as the pet had fever, Dr. Sirisha was unsure about the medication, 
she gave hell lot of injections and cannula immediately, and the pet went unconscious, then she gave another injection.
 Almost 7-8 injections she gave him, and upon questioning she said she is giving shredding injections to stop it. Non sense, and after that her assistant was so rude with the pet, 
handling it very carelessly and no sympathy at all.",0
"This Person Brijesh lacks interest and is impassive towards animals and being a doctor for animals it is very concerning
. My dog had an infection around his head due to scratching being a doctor he didn't even touch my dog what a shame.
 I was handling my dog all by myself knowing simply stood still in one corner never for a minute he came to pacify my dog.
 He left the room without any consideration his assistant is daughter is same useless
 and untutored only focused on how much should we be charged.",0
"I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated with the service provided by Dr. Sneha. 
The vet lacks basic manners, both in person and over the phone, showing no care or concern for pets or their owners.
 Her communication style is rude and off-putting. Most times, she doesn't even have 
necessary medicines, which is unacceptable.",0
"The pet hospital is just okay, but there are some issues that need improvement. 
The cleanliness is lacking, and there's a noticeable odor throughout the rooms.
 Given the payment they charge, the facilities should be in better condition, and the customer service 
needs significant improvement. They also fail to provide proper information to the clients",0
"Better hygiene and care than govmt hospitals, but the price was very high and non affordable",0
"I had a very disappointing experience at this private vet clinic when I took my 1-year 3-month-old Persian
 cat for a check-up. She was acting unusualâ€”making sounds and behaving differently than usual. 
Since she is normally very quiet and only occasionally playful, I was naturally concerned and rushed her to the vet.",0
"Completely soulless place.. Unhygienic, unprofessional, and run by doctors who lack both empathy and skill,
 prioritizing money over life.. They give false hopes and drag treatments just to pile up the bills and 
leave you with nothing but pain and regret... They couldn't care less about your pet's life..
 Your pet deserves better, dont trust them with your loved ones",0
"My dog passed away, after 2nd day of consulting. It is difficult to explain the situation. Please don't bring your pet there. Suggests other hospitals especially govt. Vets.",0
I had a worst experience in 2021 . When my father asked the doctor some doubts he responded in a very rude manner. Also charges high fees. I was forced to take my dog there because the next day was the starting of lock down of second wave of covid 19. Not recommended even its an emergency.,0
"I don't know much about the services they provide, but it's shameful that an organization claiming 
to protect animals repeatedly wastes water by leaving their motor on overnight, causing the tank to overflow for hours. 
They never answer the phone when I try to report this issue. This disrespectful behavior is unacceptable.

"We went with our female Shih Tzu to Felican Pet Hospital, Eroor on 24th February 2025 for an 
emergency medical check-up. The hospital, at the first go, diagnosed her as having a pus-filled uterus, 
which needed immediate surgery. After the surgery, we were told that there was no pus, 
but an infectious growth in the abdominal cavity was discovered. 
They did send the sample for a biopsy but did not give any proper or prompt reports.",0
"We had put our dog at their boarding facility and got our dog back almost half dead. While giving back the attender said that he is slow now and that he should be fine in few hours. We are assuming that they have given high dose of sedation injection , it took almost 3 days for our dog to recover, we almost lost him . This happened almost 5 years back but wanted to put it here so other pet parents are aware.",0
"Waiting time is TOO HIGH. Literally waited for an hour on a non peak day like monday. Especially people who come alone from faraway places, this is really bad. Because it takes 3-4 hrs in total just for a routine vet visit. Apart from this, Treatment has been great by Dr.Suchitra for my cats serious urinary issue. Rest all doctors are okay.",0
"Do not go here, trust me. I had been taking my labrador pup here from 4 years before for a skin infection
 for which they kept prescribing a skin cream called wokazole for over 1 year as they ""assumed"" it's a fungal infection.
 It was only last June when I asked them to take a skin test directly as per the direction of a vet online.
 Turned out he had bacterial infection which they didn't even consider doing even though they also prescribed antibiotics once.",0
"Terrible Experience â€“ If You Want to Save Your Pet, Never Go There!",0
"We had a horrible experience. Our chubby and adorable puppy was left in their care for 7 days due to a personal emergency. Unfortunately, they seemed to neglect her needs, and she returned to us sick and underweight. We would not recommend this facility to anyone.",0
"The waiting time is the worst here. Also they should have an ICU emergency ward for critical cases. 
And not keep the critical cases waiting for more than 45mins. Very disappointed with the management!!",0
"Today I witnessed something truly disturbing at thisoldest and most well-known veterinary hospitals in Ernakulam.
 We had taken an injured puppy there for an X-ray, and what I saw inside the X-ray room left me shocked and heartbroken.",0
Bad service ever... They are focus on only for your money.... If you are really love ur pet.. Choose another good pet hospital...,0
had a very disappointing experience with this hospital. It seemed like their primary focus was on money rather than providing proper care. They hadn't done proper grooming for my cat and also he had cuts which was very disappointing.,0
"I had a very disappointing experience with this hospital. It seemed like their primary focus was on money 
rather than providing proper care and attention to my dog. As a pet parent, 
I expect compassion and dedication, which were clearly lacking here.",0
Iâ€™ve been bringing my pet there the past 14 years. I have seen it grow to become a big business today . Now there are many vet doctors and it has become very impersonal. The wait is long esp on a Sunday as most vets are on leave. And it is expensive because they charge you for every single thing. They also maximize giving medicines to pets so thereâ€™s more business.,0
"Never go to this place if you want to save your pet, My dog ate a plastic cover and was not eating anything, 
so I visited this place continuously for almost 3 weeks and they done blood test and x-ray everytime 
i went there and they couldn't even figure out what was wrong with my dog and now my dog is dead!! 
And still I don't know what was wrong with my dog. They said different things everytime
 I went there they couldn't even figure out the real disease even after the plastic cover was came out.
 Still after that my dog wasn't eating. These people only care about money, the greed killed my dog.",0
"I'm extremely disappointed and distressed with the experience I had. I took my one-month-old kitten there for treatment,
 but unfortunately the doctors seemed careless and administered four injections",0
"For a government entity thatâ€™s supposed to start at 8AM, they sure fail in being any good leading example for all. Donâ€™t expect vets/staffs to attend to you before 9:30/10AM. If they do, you may have gotten up on the right side of the bed. They got a landline but it seems to be ringing in some other universe. The reception/front desk has an invisible staff, and the docs are always on â€œtrainingâ€ apparently. So stay prepped, take a day-off from other works, and then plan to head down to this place, as most likely going to be a long day for most.",0
"Please take your pets somewhere else if you want them to live. The doctors aren't experienced and don't know 
what they are doing. They gave my kitten the same medicine that they gave the previous cats as that's all he knows. 
He's not diagnosing the disease because He's not sure. I brought my kitten here because she wasn't eating.
 They gave her three shots of medicine in their syringe that they gave the previous cats and today morning my kitten is dead",0

I advise you people not to bring em here if you are financially okay. I'll never make the same mistake again,0
Please don't go there if your pets are important. They don't know how to identify the reasons of illness in pets. My Pet Cat died last December because of their medical negligence.,0
"Doctors are very efficient and dedicated. The problem is the place is not keeping in hygiene conditions and they place needle and syringe irresponsibly. Don't keep your pets on the floor, it may lead to any diseases.",0
You want your pets dead? Come here. Its cheeper than private thats the only thing . My 3 cats died after showing them here they dont have proper treatment but they wont even say it. Dont go here. Horrible,0
"Finally a Vet Doctor whom you can visit 24/7. The place even offers boarding for pets . A Caring Doctor, who has ideas for a gr8 Pet clinic.",0
"The worst clinic ever ! Cant even clear a doubt !!!! If you are a pet parent, i dont recommend this",0
He never did arrive at a diagnosis for the skin condition My dog had ... my dog is a dashund ...the doctor kept body shaming my dog almost every visit and kept mentioning all his skin issues are due him being over weight . Even after he lost weight the skin issues persisted. None of treatment given by him worked for us . All in all he is just TALK only .,0
"I hope everyone understand this. Their service was terrible. They are more concerned about money than pets lives.
When we see their behavior, it's as if we're taking money from them and treating them.
They only want money, so they will say something and give your pet's a lot of medicines.If you want to save your loved
 one's life, please don't go there and treated.very bad experience and very bad service",0
We had a very worst experience from both the staffâ€™s and Dr. Akhil. Very rude behaviour and uncooperative. Not at all empathetic and attentive towards the pet. I will never recommend the hospital since itâ€™s an ultimate wastage of money. The lady doctor was polite and good.,0
I had a very disappointing experience. It felt like they were more focused on making money rather than genuinely helping animals. I would not recommend this clinic to anyone who truly cares about their pets.,0
Such a bad experience .. multiple young doctors were there but misdiagnosed the condition and we suffered a lot .. how can they misdiagnose the presence of maggots by saying its just anal gland swelling !!! Poor experience.. i sware all these positive reviews are from their close circles only .. not real ones,0
Very bad experience. Worst clinic ever. Doctor's and staffs are not experienced. Giving importance to collecting money not treating pets. Negative feedback from almost all customers but not aware to put feedback in review. All the positive feedback posted here by the friends and relatives of owner's for their promotion. Don't go there,0
Accept with the hospital and the owner the hospital one best option in our town. Bt service from few of staff is very bad the way how they treat the customers. Special one of the male doctor. Accept that doctors have power but frst study how to handle the people and how to treat them.,0
Very bad Money eaters  So much greed to money. No good service to pets. Better go with Govt hospitals,0
"Pathetic so pathetic in there caring , the doctor are not experience also , it's horrible experience for me , shame to visit such a hospital, they are not doctors they are butchers , spending my time there that's was waste experience of my life",0

"Pls don't take your pets here. My dog was feeling ill for a few days, she was not eating for 2 days and was vomiting everything she ate. We have been taking her to this hospital 
for the past 3 days, they couldn't find what was wrong with her and for whole 3 days she was suffering from pain, and was not taking food.",0
"Not much dealt with the Doctor. Visited for check up of my Guinea Pig. Soft spoken, good behaviour with my 
Guinea Pig, observed, listen, checked and calm natured.",0
"The vet is not responsible. When I call, he picks up and says to send video.. done. After that he will not respond to any.. he might be busy, take a few hours but 1 day or more.. for emergency, I don't recommend..",0
"Mr Narendar (He doesnâ€™t deserve to be called a Doctor) is extremely unprofessional and impolite.
 After calling him to ask about one of our Cats and offering consultation payments in advance, he never got back to us 
or even bothered to respond to our multiple messages. When asked for an update he just rudely spoke and cut the call !",0
Worst pet service providers in tricityâ€¦. I donâ€™t recommend this clinic to anyoneâ€¦.,0
"Worst experience . Doctors vr good but owner is really very very greedy.Charges beyond expectations.
Dont share the budget before head and argues afterwards.No need to go there ever.There are very good expertise
 in surrounding areas.Never going to share details of this clinic to anyone.Charging 400-500 just for giving only one 
intramuscular injection and that too with my own medicine.Be aware of such greedy useless people",0
My puppy came back more stressed than when I dropped him off. The staff seemed annoyed with every question I asked. Never going back,0
The vet handled my cat roughly and didnâ€™t listen to my concerns. My cat was trembling afterward. Completely heartbroken,0
Thanks to vet for saving my puppy from deadly parvovirus. Timely care was ensured,0

"The vet is not responsible. When I call, he picks up and says to send video.. done. After that he will not respond to any..
 he might be busy, take a few hours but 1 day or more.. for emergency, I don't recommend..",0
"Pathetic. A black spot in a doctor's name. Please do not play with your loved pet's life.
 This person doesn't know what he's doing. Does not answer your questions, talks rudely and 
simply doesn't care about your pet. Even when we called him saying there was no improvement, 
he simply did not care and rudely disconnected the call.",0
"Fake 24*7 hospital nobody will check before their timing its a totally private clinic. My dog was having emergency
 situation and called the doctor Mr. Narender he told he will come at 6pm only not before that even 
i told him that its serious problem. Totally disgusting.",0
"Most pathetic vet clinica ever seenâ€¦ they wrongly diagnosed my cat just on basis of their assumptionsâ€¦ 
no testsâ€¦ no examinationâ€¦ which led the worsening of her health. Advise not to go there if you have a cat",0
"When I was at his clinic I observed that he kept using the same medicines for all kind of ailments - treating everyone for tick fever without the proper tests. He is vain and kept getting offended when I asked him about our dogâ€™s treatment, which made me doubt his practice and ethics.",0
"The person is not even checking the patient ,checked my dog with another vet in chandigarh and diagnosis says my dog got parvo and this bloody vet gave fever medicine. The worst vet ever not even checking the patients properly.",0
"Doctor is somewhat knowledgeable. But his attitude is so bad. He doesn't know how to speak. Doesn't know how 
to treat animals. No empathy at all",0
"The scaner machine is old, the scan didn't come out clear enough, we had to repeat it at another clinic. Our dog was misdiagnosed and treated for an issue he didn't have because of it. Hygiene is not great.",0
"I had very bad experience with them three times.Their diagnosis are poor straight way the put dog on drip 
and induce excessive medicine.. They know dog is dying will not servive even then they will forcibly give so many tonics . 
I have lost three dogs with them with wrong medication.",0
"Went there to get my male cat neutered bit apparently they don't do that there. Tje doctor asked me to visit 
Panchkula's Hospital for the same. Rest I believe it's good for a routine check up",0
"Horrible doctor. Went with my pet and she did not even look at him properly. 
Randomly wrote prescription before i even told his symptoms.",0
"I don't know how they treat animals like cats and dogs but they are not certified doctor to treat rabbits.
 They gave wrong medicine to my rabbit and she died due to that reaction. They are just having a degree but 
not a qualified one. Shame on them",0
Good for only big animals like cow buffalo goat etc. Doctors are not capable to diagnose pets like dogs cats etc.,0
Medicines are not available here. You have to walk for 5 minutes to reach out to a chemist shop to buy medicine/injections.,0
"Worst doctor ever he doesn't care about anyone my meow kitten 3 month old died just because of overdose after 
giving injection she died in an hour. Kisi ko experience nhi hai meri meow ko maar diya please don't
 go go to someone who has good knowledge",0
"Worst hospital ever , the doctor were not attentive and was not listening to the symptoms of my pet and
 didn't even check her condition and he overdosed the medicine and after 1 hour my pet died,
I hated it and wanted to request everyone that if you really love do not go to this hospital",0
Very low price and great service. It's just the timing you should be aware of. Timing is 9-2,0
"They just promoting themselves they show open but actually it's closed my dog was very serious from 3 days
 and the staff said go to any other hospital and more over doctor also not present. Government should
 open it 24 hours working. Because state means each and everyone love in it",0
Very nonsense person.Not a expert doctor.,0
"No compassion, no empathy.Our 7 week old Cocker Spaniel puppy being treated by Dr Nijjer expired,despite repeated 
assurances that it will survive. It came as a big shock to us; and more shocking was no response from him when we 
messaged him this information. Doctor should realise that pets are like family members for owners, 
he should give correct information and show some concern and feelings.",0
"They don't even pick up calls. How is a person supposed to ask for help? If doctor is available or not?
 I called 7-8 times, it was an emergency but they didn't even pick up! I mean, why do you guys do it???
 Update your number!",0
"He do not have any kind of konwledge about pets everyone is requested not to take your pet to him. 
I want to gave 0 star to him but i can not . If you want that your pet may live do not take your pet to him",0
"I go for sterilization of my female dog,,,,,my dog was operated in April,,,in July my dog is in chronic liver infection,,,it was biggest mistake of my life",0

"Dr.Deepinderjit was very polite, examined my pet dog diligently, provided the necessary treatment and home care advice.
 Highly recommend PetCare clinic Hallo Majra, Chandigarh for all health related issues for your pets",0
I donâ€™t recommend this clinic to all pet lovers and owners. Highly overpriced and moreover they just want to sell you the medicine and call you again for visits but doesnâ€™t listen to your query.,0
"Not at all recommended! Did not diagnose my dog's disease, wasted his precious last few months by calling him
 again and again for application of medicine. Treated him for an incorrect disease. Bandaged my dog's legs which led to
 damage of his joints and ultimately his death. If you love your dog, please do not take him to this vet. 
He wasted over 6 months of our dog's life",0
"Lost my beloved dog to wrong diagnosis. Wrong treatment - giving anesthesia to aggressive dog, rather than a milder thing. Suggesting uterus removal when lungs had fluid. And lots of other things thT went wrong in treating my 7 year old pet.",0
"Even if u visit Max superior Specialty hospital in Mohali after one visit next three days free for visit & constellation .
But here every next day you have to visit for your child special advisory given & have to pay constellation evey time ... 
Totally over charging...",0
"Not a very pleasant experience , no relief to the dog but you are advised plethora of tests and medicines.
 Changed my Dog's vet and feeling lot better now . Avoid .",0
"I want to give zero rating but there is no option for zero rating. I take my rabbit here. At that time rabbit was in okay
 condition with weight of 400 grams. But when they give him treatment and tell me give hime medicines. 
After 2 days my rabbit's weight is about 100 grams. And sadly after a week he died just because of them. 
They just make money. They have no emotions",0
"Dr Growar is not at all worth it until and unless he is making money out of you, he and his female staff 
are very sweet and generous. The day they know they couldn't loot there customers 
they will start becoming rude and their attitude changes drastically.",0
"This so called doctor is a big NO, he is absolutely having no knowledge, worst than that he is a thief,
 as and when you'll enter his premises, he will keep on trying to sell his medicines, telling that your dog is having this & that,
 he intentionally mis-diagnosed my dog with Cardiomegaly ( enlargement of heart ) and 
sold me so many medicines which were also expensive and at the same time harmful from his own clinic 
by telling that you'll have to start these medicines asap, I bought them but even consulted
 other doctors and came to know that my dog was absolutely fine...",0
"Lost my pet because doctor didn't tell me that my dog had distemper.Kept making money and 
delayed the initial period of the disease. Keeps on selling his products at hefty prices.There are better vets in Chandigarh .

"The owner doesn't have the manners to talkThis is the worst place in Chandigarh, please don't bring your pet",0
Worst experience ever & they donâ€™t care about your dogs,0
"Don't take your pet to this clinic, all they want is money. I took a stray pupp (1 month old), who was critically serious.

 generously and after an hour they found no improvement in puppy's health and
 asked me to take the puppy home(before he passes) and bring tomorrow again.",0

"The worst doctor I have ever seen. Please do not take your dog to this hospital they will kill your

 overdose and carelessness my 2 pug dog passed away. I am going to report this to govt. Indian pet committee.",0
"They are the worst doctor, couldn't identify what was wrong with my dog and blamed everything on the poor
 soul that his cancer spread within 1 week. He was absolutely fine until i took him to this clinic for surgery, 
knowing what his condition is surgeon went on a 2-3 days vacation. And the staff couldn't even follow the doctor's
 precipitation and had to tell the other doctor that the surgeon had advised for injections in the eye.
 They are so unprofessional and do not take their patient's life seriously.
 I lost my baby, please save your's from people like these.",0
"My cat was getting treated from this clinic for 2yrs for same cause. They never treated her root cause rather just 
did the temporary treatment. Until the point she couldnâ€™t survive the treatment anymore and she finally died. 
They never give you a clear picture. I think their main goal isnâ€™t to completely treating the pet but rather 
to keep up the number of active patients in the clinic.",0
"Very bad experience, I have a shih Tzu and they cut his face hair very unequally and in very hurry",0
"One of the worst experience of my life after sector 22 dispensary.... i request everyone to not to get their

"From my experience, the staff and even the doctors here are only money-minded and not genuinely concerned 
about the petsâ€™ well-being.Thatâ€™s why I strongly suggest all pet parents to think 100 times before leaving their pets here, 
keeping your petâ€™s health and safety in mind",0
Please think twice before leaving your pet here if you care about their well-being. We will never be returning.,0
"Absolutely disappointed with the service here. The girl at the front desk has zero customer service skills. 
Without even listening to my question, she rudely said â€œlena hai toh loâ€ and cut the call. This is not the way to treat a customer.
 At the very least, she should listen to the query before ending the conversation.After that, they didnâ€™t respond back at all.",0
